# parcel-react-typescript

As the name states it: a simple parcel-react-typescript starter (also with scss)... [parcel][get-started] is amazing. Support for all of the above mentioned is ready __out of the box__ (except [scss][parcel-scss], which requires the installation of... OH, ONE DEPENDENCY). 

To run:
1. git clone
1. npm install
1. npm start

[parcel-scss]: https://en.parceljs.org/assets.html#scss
